# Sound Files

This directory is for manually uploading notification sound files that will be used in the app.

Please place the following sound files in this directory:

- `notification.mp3`: Sound played when notifications are received
- `login.mp3`: Sound played on successful login

These files will be accessed directly from the public folder instead of being bundled with the app assets.
