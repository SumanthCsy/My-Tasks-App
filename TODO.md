# Task Implementation Plan

## 1. Navigation from Dashboard to Compiler
- [ ] Update `frontend/app/user/index.tsx` to navigate to compiler page when "Start Learning" is clicked for programming courses

## 2. Add Complete Task Button to Compiler Pages
- [ ] Update `frontend/app/admin/webCompiler.tsx` to add "Complete Task" button with trophy animation modal
- [ ] Update `frontend/app/user/webCompiler.tsx` to add "Complete Task" button with trophy animation modal

## 3. Admin-Only Login Notifications
- [ ] Update `frontend/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` to ensure "User just logged in" popup only shows to admin
- [ ] Update `frontend/utils/DialogManager.tsx` if needed for admin notifications

## 4. Update Login/Logout Design Theme
- [ ] Update `frontend/app/auth/login.tsx` to remove success dialog and change design theme (no popups)
- [ ] Update logout design if needed

## 5. Testing
- [ ] Test navigation from dashboard to compiler for programming courses
- [ ] Test complete task button functionality and trophy animation
- [ ] Test login notifications appear only to admin
